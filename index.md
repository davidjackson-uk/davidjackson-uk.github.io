# My Research

Welcome to my PhD research website. I am interested in **how managers use data to inform their people management decision making in organisations**. I am particularly interested in how the combination of sensor technology, big data and machine processing developments impact people management decisions. I am conducting my research at the *Decent Work and Productivity Research Centre* within Manchester Metropolitan University.

I am using [Grounded Theory](http://www.groundedtheory.com/) as developed by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss to undertake my research with security officers in the UK. 

# Technology

I am taking the opportunities presented by my PhD research project to develop my technology and coding skills. I am prioritising the use of Free and Open Source (FOSS) software and code in the development of my research, my analysis and my presentation.

You can see a one page overview of how I am using FOSS [here](my_academic_workflow.pdf).
