I am an academic researcher and coding hobbyist. I am taking the opportunities provided by a multi-year PhD research project to explore what the world of Free and Open Source (FOSS) software, code and resources such as GitHub have to offer me in 2022. 

As I am learning and taking my own notes, I thought it might be helpful to also capture my experiences here so that other researchers can get a headstart on their own attempts to explore what a very basic level of coding know how can do for their own work.
