# Command Line shortcuts (Aliases)
One of the big challenges in moving from Windows to Linux - and specifically the commans line - was how to work with shortcuts. If I wanted to get to a particular directory quickly, I didn't want to have to keep 'CD ing' through lots of directories to get to the level I wanted. 

This is why I was so excited to learn about aliases.

I think of aliases as nick names for locations. They mean that I can tell my computer that when I say journals I want it to take me to the journals directory of my research file structure.

It's really easy once you get your head around the fact that you need to edit your .bashrc file first.

First of all, nvaigate to your home directory.

> cd ~

Then access the .bashrc file using whatever editor you prefer. I use Nano but guess that any will do the job for you.

> nano .bashrc
