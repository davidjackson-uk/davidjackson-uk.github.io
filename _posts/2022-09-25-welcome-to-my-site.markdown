I've always loved playing around with software. When I was a kid, we had an Acorn Electron which was marketed as the junior version of the BBC Micro - the machine adopted by schools in the UK in the mid-eighties. My first experience of coding was in copying out lines of BASIC form magazines like 'Acorn User' to build little games and graphics programmes. It was a solid way to learn a language and threw you right in the deep end without any real kind of foundation. I loved it.

After the Electron I moved on to the Sinclair Spectrum before my first IBM/PC: an i386 running DOS and Windows 3.1. I was 16 when I bought this machine second hand from a friend and I spent hours exploring Windows, version 2.0 of Microsoft Office and Doom - all of which came on 3.5" floppy disks. 

After I got to University in 1997 (studying Philosophy - computers were still just a hobby) I eventually bought a new computer running Windows 95 and then 98. It was sometime in my second year at university that I first installed Suse Linux - the free and open source (FOSS) operating system. For reasons I could never quite figure out - I fell in love with it. It was bloody difficult to use for somebody with no personal network or access to the Internet to figure out - but there was a beauty to it and a real feeling of achievement whenever I did manage to solve a problem. Back in those days, even getting your printer driver to work was a challenge so it was a steep learning curve. 

My love affair with Linux remains to this day. I do use Windows for a lot of my work (I run a business in addition to my research) but for my studies I use Linux Mint. This doesn't mean that I have two computers though. I 'dual boot' my PC. This means that when I switch it on, instead of launching Windows straight away I am presented with a menu asking me which operating system I want to use: Windows 11 or Linux Mint. If I am going to be doing commercial work for clients, I choose Windows. If I am going to be working on my PhD, I choose Linux.

Although the University I am studying with provides some excellent software for qualitative research, it tends to be commercial proprietary software. Whilst I have nothing against that, I love the principle of free and open source software and so am trying to use that instead wherever I can. This means that almost everything is a leaning curve for me. I love that - learning genuinely motivates me and helps me out of slumps - but I know that I do also make life harder for myself from time to time by not just taking the easy option. 

**All of this is a long way of me saying that what I am putting together for this website is not likely to be the easiest way to undertake research of any kind. If you are looking for an easy life, look elsewhere!** If though, you are also somebody who gets excited about playing with software, coding, learning and about free and open source resources, then this record of my experiences may be helpful for you in undertaking your own academic research or other work.

I will be updating this website alongside my studies to set out what I am using, how I am using it, and how you can use it yourself.
